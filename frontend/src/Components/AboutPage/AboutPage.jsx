              <p>
                Iâ€™m a Computer Science graduate with a passion for web and app
                development, as well as design. My curiosity for tech led me to
                explore full-stack development and UI/UX design through hands-on
                projects, bootcamps, and seminars.

              <p>
                I build fast, scalable, and user-friendly web and mobile apps.
                My work combines strong frontend skills with robust backend
                logic and creative UI/UX design.

              <p>
                Clean, maintainable code and thoughtful design. I focus on
                understanding user needs, planning effectively, and delivering
                on time.

            <p>
              My aspiration is to continuously enhance my professional
              development as a developer, engaging in challenging projects and
              actively contributing to the technological community. Having
              recently learned app development and design skills, I am excited
              to apply these new competencies in real-world projects. I am
              consistently enthusiastic about acquiring new technologies and
              exploring the boundaries of what is feasible in web development
              and app design.
